SPOT THE BIRD is a web application that lets bird watchers track their sightings, find out where certain species have been sighted, and connect with fellow bird lovers through a messaging system. It has been built with Rails, JavaScript, Mapbox, Cloudinary, and with descriptions of birds scraped from Wikipedia.

Planned features to be added in the near future:
- real time chat updates with WebSocket
- image upload for when a user adds a bird to the database
- functionality to add contacts
- search bar
